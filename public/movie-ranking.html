    <h3>Love Jones</h3>
    <p>Nia Long and Larenz Tate in the ultimate Black Love Story. #relationshipgoals for sure!</p>
    
    <h3>Usual Suspects</h3>
    <p>Quentin Tarantino at his best; a psychological thriller.</p>
   
    <h3>Girls Trip</h3>
    <p>This was a movie that mimics our infamous Miami trip in 2010.</p>
   
    <h3>The Hangover</h3>
    <p>The original, guys version of Girls Trip. Super Funny--I saw it in the theater twice!</p>
    
    <h3>Black Panther</h3>
    <p>Marvel. Black Superhero. Amazing to finally see a Superhero in the likeness of Black Excellence! #wakandaforever</p>
